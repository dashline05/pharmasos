## Introduction
It's midnight. You have a terrible headache, or your baby urgently needs syrup. You grab your phone to look for the nearest open pharmacy, and two terms often pop up: **duty pharmacy** (pharmacie de garde) and **24/7 pharmacy** (pharmacie 24h/24).

While both options allow you to buy your medicines in the middle of the night, they operate in very different ways. So, which one should you choose? Are the prices the same?

## What is a duty pharmacy?
The duty pharmacy does not work at night or on weekends by choice, but by legal obligation and solidarity. To ensure access to healthcare for all citizens, the pharmacists' syndicate organizes a rotation schedule.

Taking turns, the pharmacies in the same neighborhood take over outside regular opening hours. There are two types:

1. **The day shift:** These are the pharmacies that open on Sundays and public holidays (generally from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.).
1. **The night shift:** They take over from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. the next morning.
    - <b>Detail to remember:</b> A duty pharmacy today won't be one tomorrow. It's a temporary status.

## What is a 24/7 pharmacy?
Unlike duty pharmacies, a 24/7 pharmacy has a special authorization to never close its doors. Whether it's 2 p.m. on a Tuesday or 3 a.m. on a Sunday, its status is permanent.

However, they are much rarer. For example, a large metropolis like Casablanca has hundreds of pharmacies, but only about thirty have the 24/7 status.

## The Great Comparison: Prices, distances, and choices

Do medicines cost more at night? **No! That's a common misconception.**[^1] In Morocco, the Public Sale Price of medicines is set by the State. There is no "night tax."

Criteria | Duty Pharmacy | 24/7 Pharmacy
--:|:--|:--
**Status** | Temporary (Rotation) | Permanent
**Proximity** | Very close (In every neighborhood) | Farther (Main roads)
**Night Price** | Identical to daytime | Identical to daytime

## Find the right pharmacy without wasting time
In a nighttime emergency, no one has the time or energy to drive around the neighborhood reading small paper signs stuck on windows.
