## Introduction
Imagine the scene: it's 3 a.m., your child has a high fever that won't go down, and your box of paracetamol is empty. It's exactly in this kind of panic moment that the **duty pharmacy** system becomes your best ally.

But how exactly is this system organized? Are there specific rules you need to know? And above all, how do you avoid driving around the city in the middle of the night looking for an open door?

## What is a duty pharmacy?
In Morocco, public health requires a **continuity of care**. This means you must be able to get emergency medicines 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.

A duty pharmacy is therefore a pharmacy that has a legal obligation to remain open outside of normal working hours. Instead of all the pharmacies in a city staying open at night (which would be impossible to manage), they organize themselves with a rotation system.

### Day Shift vs Night Shift: What is the difference?
The Pharmacists' Syndicate in each city (like Casablanca, Rabat, or Marrakech) establishes a strict schedule to distribute the shifts. There are two main types of shifts:

- The day shift (Sundays and public holidays): These pharmacies take over when others close for the weekend. They are generally open from morning until evening (often from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.).
- The night shift: This is the nocturnal relay. These pharmacies generally open starting at 8:00 p.m. (standard closing time) and close at 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. the next morning.
    - <b>Good to know:</b> There are also pharmacies open 24/7.
    - Unlike duty pharmacies which rotate, these have a special status that allows them to never close their doors, day or night.

## Do medicines cost more at night?
This is a very common question! The answer is no.[^1]

In Morocco, the Public Sale Price (PPV) of medicines is strictly regulated by the Ministry of Health. Whether you buy your treatment at 2:00 p.m. on a Tuesday or at 4:00 a.m. on a holiday Sunday, the price of the medicine remains exactly the same.

    <summary>Why serve through a window at night?</summary>
    It is important to note that for security reasons, many duty pharmacies close their main door at night and serve you through a secure window. Don't hesitate to ring the bell if no one is at the counter!
</details>

> In summary: The duty system is a chain of solidarity among pharmacists to ensure you never lack care. The next time you have a nighttime emergency, don't panic, don't take your car at random: make it a habit to check online which duty pharmacy is open in your neighborhood.
